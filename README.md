# Weather Reporter SL

A secure, modern, and user-centric weather reporting platform. Users can register, verify their email, reset passwords, submit and view weather/risk updates (with images), and manage their profilesâ€”all with robust authentication and a responsive, mobile-friendly UI.

## Features

- **User Registration & Email Verification:**
  - Register with username, email, password, and country.
  - Verification email sent; only verified users can log in.
- **Secure Authentication:**
  - JWTs stored in httpOnly, secure cookies (not localStorage).
  - All sensitive routes protected by authentication middleware.
- **Password Reset:**
  - Request password reset via email; time-limited, single-use reset link.
  - Secure flow never reveals if an email is registered.
- **Login/Logout:**
  - Secure login/logout flows with clear feedback and session management.
- **Add Weather Updates & Risk Alerts:**
  - Authenticated users can submit general weather updates and risk alerts (e.g., floods, wildfires) for any location.
  - Risk alerts support image uploads (via Cloudinary).
- **Location-Based Search & Updates:**
  - Search for any city/country and view both general weather updates and risk alerts for that area.
  - Dashboard shows nearby updates.
- **User Profile Management:**
  - View and update profile (username, country).
- **Responsive UI:**
  - Mobile-first design with sidebar for desktop/tablet and bottom navigation for mobile.
  - All forms and cards optimized for usability.
- **UX Enhancements:**
  - Loaders for major actions (login, register, submissions).
  - Password fields have visibility toggles.

## Security & Best Practices

- **JWT in httpOnly Cookies:**
  - Prevents XSS token theft. Cookies set with `secure: true` and `sameSite: 'none'` in production.
  - `trust proxy` set for Heroku.
- **CORS Configuration:**
  - Backend CORS allows the exact frontend origin and credentials.
  - Heroku config vars used for dynamic origin.
- **CSRF Protection:**
  - Planned with recommendations for using `csurf` and exposing a CSRF token endpoint.
- **No Sensitive Data in localStorage:**
  - All authentication handled via cookies.
- **Email Security:**
  - Verification and password reset flows use secure, single-use, time-limited tokens.

## Noteworthy Design Choices

- **Security-First:** All sensitive actions require authentication; app never leaks user existence.
- **User Experience:** Password visibility toggles, responsive loaders, and clear feedback.
- **Scalable API Structure:** Model-based DB access and middleware-protected routes.
- **Mobile-First Design:** UI adapts for both desktop and mobile users.

---

## Troubleshooting & Debugging

- **CORS & Cookies:**
  - Ensure frontend and backend origins are set correctly in environment variables.
  - Cookies must be set with `secure: true` and `sameSite: 'none'` for cross-origin in production.
  - Heroku requires `app.set('trust proxy', 1)` for secure cookies.
- **Email Delivery:**
  - Check SMTP configuration if verification or reset emails are not received.
- **Weather API Limitations:**
  - Some APIs may not provide all data (e.g., UV index on free plans).
